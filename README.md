    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    
> The aim of this Research is to contribute to the diagnosis of epilepsy by taking advantage of the engineering. So, for diagnosing of epileptic seizures from EEG signals are transformed discrete wavelet and auto regressive models. After these transformations, extract data is applied input for Back-propagation, KNN, Linear SVM, SVM, ANN ,Logistic Regression.
